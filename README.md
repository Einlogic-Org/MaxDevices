### Kill Switch
https://github.com/Einlogic-Org/MaxDevices/raw/main/Devices/Kill%20Switch.amxd

A Midi effect device that is used to force note off and sustain pedal up midi messages whenever your rig malfunctions and one or more note off or sustain pedal up messages get lost.  Just add it to your effects chain for each of your midi tracks.  You can optionally midi map it to create an easy "kill switch" from your keyboard without having to fiddle with a mouse or computer keyboard for those emergency moments on stage.
