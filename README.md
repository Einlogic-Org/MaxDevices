### Kill Switch
https://github.com/Einlogic-Org/MaxDevices/raw/main/Devices/Kill%20Switch.amxd

A Midi effect device that is used to force note off and sustain pedal up midi messages whenever your rig malfunctions and one or more note off or sustain pedal up messages get lost.  Just add it to your effects chain for each of your midi tracks.  You can optionally midi map it to create an easy "kill switch" from your keyboard without having to fiddle with a mouse or computer keyboard for those emergency moments on stage.

### Channel Strip
https://github.com/Einlogic-Org/MaxDevices/raw/main/Devices/Channel%20Strip.amxd

A Midi effect device that allows for selecting what channels from the input midi device are allowed to pass into the patch.  This becomes very useful when setting up an Ableton project where there is a single Master Midi track that all other tracks want to reference, but still provide seperatio at the midi channel level to allow the individual midi sources to play individual patches.  The channel strip also allows for overlapping midi channels (such as track 1 accepting midi channels 1,2 & 3 while track 2 accepts channels 1 & 3 only)
